Masai school is a great platform for those people who want to develop
programming skills and also help to develop communication skills.
Masai school has pay after placement policy, it help to students who 
are not financial independent. Masai has best curriculum i even seen 
in any other coding school.

My journey in Masai school in earliar days was difficult for me, but 
masai always motivates and give that confidence to me that i can also
able to code.I also participate in zoom marathon challenge.The overall 
experience of unit 1 is great.
